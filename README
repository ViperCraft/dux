# dux

dux is replacement of UNIX du(1) with nice output.
Using dux is good to quickly find out which dirs are heaviest one

## Usage

`$ dux -P3 ~/`

this will print directories giving >= 3% to total space.
For example, on my machine it will output:

`/home/dkrot/ [32.1G, 100%]`
` \_ smr [14.7G, 45%]`
` |   \_ src [10.1G, 31%]`
` |   |   \_ testsuite [2.8G, 8%]`
` |   |   \_ .svn [2.6G, 8%]`
` |   |   |   \_ pristine [2.5G, 7%]`
` |   |   \_ projects [1.6G, 4%]`
` |   |   \_ bin [1.3G, 4%]`
` |   \_ build [4.6G, 14%]`
` |       \_ projects [2.6G, 8%]`
` \_ .clion10 [7.1G, 22%]`
` |   \_ system [7.1G, 22%]`
` |       \_ cmake [6.6G, 20%]`
` |           \_ generated [6.6G, 20%]`
` |               \_ eed9becd [6.6G, 20%]`
` |                   \_ eed9becd [6.6G, 20%]`
` |                       \_ MinSizeRel [1.7G, 5%]`
` |                       |   \_ contrib [1.0G, 3%]`
` |                       \_ RelWithDebInfo [1.4G, 4%]`
` |                       \_ Debug [1.4G, 4%]`
` |                       \_ Release [1.4G, 4%]`
` \_ Yandex.Disk [4.4G, 13%]`
` |   \_ Camera Uploads [3.4G, 10%]`
` \_ Downloads [2.5G, 7%]`
` \_ build [1.2G, 3%]`

And I can easily see, what I forgot to remove CLion parsed data (7Gb) :-)
